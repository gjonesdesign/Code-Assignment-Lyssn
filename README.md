 Site user list via Javascript  and JSON

 # Description
 Site is made by creating an array in javascript via user data in a JSON file, then looping through the array and creating a list element for every user. The elements are contained and centered in a flexbox container, and will stay in the center of the webpage even when the page is resized. 

 Additionally, this was updated by adding an onclick event to each name that would display their user ID via a dialogue box. If an new ID is clicked, the previous dialogue box is replaced as to not create duplicate, stacked IDs.
